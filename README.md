# NgrxShoppingList

This project illustrates how to use ngrx, with effects, to manage a shopping list that is saved in a remote server (a REST API).

The REST API is served by a json-server that is using src/db.json data file

## Start servers

Run `npm start` to concurrently run the json-server on port 3000 (`http://localhost:3000/`) and the shopping list application on port `http://localhost:4200/`
